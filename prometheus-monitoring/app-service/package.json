Provides: Metric types (Counter, Gauge, Histogram, Summary), Default Node.js metrics (CPU, memory, GC), Prometheus text format exporter. Why? This is what makes our app 'Prometheus-ready'. It handles all the complexity of metric formatting and collection. Without this, we'd have to manually format metrics in Prometheus text format (very tedious!).

  "_final_note_package_managers": "npm is the default Node.js package manager. Alternatives: yarn (faster, created by Facebook), pnpm (more efficient disk usage). All work with package.json, just different install commands."
